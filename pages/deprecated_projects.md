Time is limited, and so is motivation. Every now and then one of my open source projects will
be deprecated and listed here.

## Anonymizer

* An apache logfile analyzer written in Ruby on Rails aggregating the bits dowloaded for podcast
  episodes by episode into an SQLite data base.
  All other data, is ignored. By dividing the bits downloaded by the file size, a very honest
  number of downloads is calculated.
* Several podcasts can be analyzed, data over all episodes of one podcast is available aggregated as well.
* Archive [Location](https://gitlab.informatom.com/informatom1/anonymizer)
* Reason for deprecation: I looked into the statistics maybe once a year. I actually don't need them,
it seems. But maintaining the software costs time. And most of my other projects are not Ruby on
Rails projects any more.
