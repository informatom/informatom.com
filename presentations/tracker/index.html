# 2018

* lost weight and good progress in winter and spring
* not much progress during summer (actual regression)
* [Ganzohr 2018](https://wissenschaftspodcasts.de/blog/wisspod/ganzohr2018-programm-online/)
* In preperation:
  * Started with interval training
  * Increased training frequency to 4 times a week
  * Started a running log for discussions with the trainer

* I'm quite a privacy nerd and I love static sites, so I developed tracker

What is it?

# The Plan

* Wanted to play with [Open Streetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and
  [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for a long time
* Want to try out a new plotting library: [Taucharts](https://www.taucharts.com/)
* Using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a base
* Data comes from a [Garmin Forerunner 235](https://buy.garmin.com/de-AT/AT/p/529988)

---
# Code!

* Fit file format: [Fit SDK](https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/)
* Gem [fit-parser](https://github.com/zhublik/fit_parser)

* Not a lot of code necessary to create posts from fit files:
  [Activity Parser](https://github.com/haslinger/tracker/blob/master/activity-parser.rb)

* creating the Map and the Plots from the posts yaml files:
  [Map Layout](https://github.com/haslinger/tracker/blob/master/_layouts/map.html)

* Code on [Github](https://github.com/haslinger/tracker/)
* Working [Demo Site](https://haslinger.github.io/tracker/)

# Future
